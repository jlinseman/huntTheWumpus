     To Do List:
     1. Output instructions
     2. Create game world using a 2D string array (5 x 5 Box)
     3. Add hazards to game world and make them so they interact with the player (Pit, bats, wumpus) 
     4. Create system that manuevers the player through the game world and keeps track of where the player goes.
     5. Create a way for the player to shoot arrows in the direction of the wumpus and if the player misses the wumpus changes location (5 arrows)
     6. Make it so when a arrow is sent to the location of the wumpus the player wins and outputs a ending statement
